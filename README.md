# Colour-Brain game

A modest browser based version of the brilliant card game Colour-Brain.

1 player, 3 lives, 10 colours. Have at it. Host version available here: (link inbound)

## How to play

Cards on screen will ask for colours of every day objects, signs, logos or even pop culture references. Play the matching number of colours and submit. Make a mistake and you will lose a life, loose all three and the game will end!
